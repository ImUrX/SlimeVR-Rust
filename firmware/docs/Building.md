# Building
For building you need to uncomment and comment a lot of files. Let's start in parts
## [Cargo.toml](../Cargo.toml#L17)
```toml
default = ["mcu-esp32c3", "imu-stubbed", "log-rtt", "net-wifi"]
# default = ["mcu-nrf52840", "imu-stubbed", "log-usb-serial", "net-stubbed"]
# default = ["mcu-esp32", "imu-stubbed", "log-uart", "net-wifi"]
```

You need to uncomment the one you want to use, then comment the one that wasn't. In this case, we are gonna use `mcu-esp32c3`.

We will change the `imu-stubbed` to a supported one which are the following:
- `imu-bmi160`
- `imu-mpu6050` (Compatible with other MPUs but only 6-DoF)

The log and net can be leaved as it is for now.

## [config.toml](../.cargo/config.toml)
### How to select `target`
```toml
target = "riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf"
# target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf"
# target = "xtensa-esp32-none-elf"
```

The following table shows the appropiate target for the `mcu`:
| `target` | Compatible `mcu` |
| --- | --- |
| `riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf` | `mcu-esp32c3` |
| `thumbv7em-none-eabihf` | `mcu-nrf52840`, `mcu-nrf52832` |
| `xtensa-esp32-none-elf` | `mcu-esp32` |

### Modifying `env` variables
```toml
[env]
# You can override this via environment variable when building or by changing it here
DEFMT_LOG = "debug"

# Change to your wifi's or override with environment variables.
SSID = "ssid"
PASSWORD = "password"
```

Each variable configures how the code will work, follow this table for description on each one:

| `[env]` variables | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DEFMT_LOG` | There is an explanation on [`defmt`'s docs](https://defmt.ferrous-systems.com/filtering.html) but you should probably use `debug` or `trace` for development and `info` for normal usage |
| `SSID` | The name of your Wi-Fi, only needed when using the `net-wifi` feature |
| `PASSWORD` | The password of your Wi-Fi, same as above |
| `SDA_PIN` | Pin used in your board for `SDA` on your IMU |
| `SCL_PIN` | Pin used in your board for `SCL` on your IMU |

#### Pinout format
Use the following table on how the pins should be formatted for env variables:
| Board family | Pinout format |
| --- | --- |
| nRF52 boards | It uses the GPIO pins [(example in light yellow)](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/114/673/original/circuitpython_Adafruit_Feather_nRF52840_Pinout.png?1662064111), which are demarked as `P0.11`, you only need to write the numbers so `0.11` but instead of `.` use `_` |
| ESP32 boards | It uses the GPIO pins [(example in light green)](https://espressif-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/_images/esp32-c3_devkitM-1_pinlayout.png), which are demarked as `GPIO9`, you only need to write the numbers so just `9` in this case |

## If using ``xtensa``-based boards
You need to edit [rust-toolchain.toml](../rust-toolchain.toml):
```toml
channel = "nightly-2022-12-18"
# channel = "esp" # for when compiling to xtensa targets
```
Just uncomment the `"esp"` channel and comment the other one. You also need to install the toolchain itself which there is [a guide in here for](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/installation/installation.html#espup).

# Flashing
Ok, this part is hellish. You need to know what you are doing if you select a complicated method or use a weird board because, maybe you will have missing drivers (Windows ðŸ‘€), or maybe if using a probe it's not working correctly, or you just did the pinout wrong, or just the board hates you.

But this guide's objective is to try to help you and if you manage to do something that wasn't easy or explained you can pull request it to here, so you can help people and don't make them suffer like you did! 

| Method | Compatible devices |
| --- | --- |
| [USB-JTAG](#usb-jtag-method) (very easy) | `mcu-esp32c3` |
| [`espflash`](#espflash-method) (very easy) | All ESP32 devices **with the default ESP first-stage bootloader** |
| [`nrfdfu`](#nrfdfu-method) (easy) | All nRF devices **with a DFU bootloader** |
| [`probe-rs`](#probe-rs-method) (normal) | Any device with SWD or JTAG |


## USB-JTAG method
You will need to install `cargo-embed`, so do `cargo install cargo-embed` and plug your device through USB.

After installing it you can just do `cargo embed` and maybe it will ask you which device it should flash, you choose your device, and it will flash it. After that it will start monitoring the device but you can just `Ctrl+C` it.

With that all done, you have your device flashed!

## `espflash` method
You will need to install `cargo-espflash`, so do `cargo install cargo-espflash --version "2.0.0-rc.2"` and plug your device through USB.

After installing it you can just do `cargo espflash flash` and maybe it will tell you that it requires specifying the device, so you specify one. It will flash it, and you are done!

## `probe-rs` method
You first need a probe, we mostly use a Raspberry Pi Pico with [`picoprobe`](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe). Then you need to connect the probe pins to the appropiate pins of your board (you will need to google that).

You will have to configure the [Embed.toml](../Embed.toml) to the appropiate settings of the device you want to flash, usually the `protocol` and `chip` variables are the one needing change.

Install `cargo-embed`, so do `cargo install cargo-embed` and plug your probe to your PC.

After having everything, just do `cargo embed` and it should just work!

## `nrfdfu` method
Install `nrfdfu`, you do that with `cargo install nrfdfu`. Then connect your nRF through USB.

After installing you will need to `cargo build` and then do `nrfdfu target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/firmware` (it can be `release` instead of `debug` if you are building with the release profile). It will flash your nRF and you are done!
